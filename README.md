# Skin Options Website
A simple multipage website that can connect skin concerns and skin goals with various skin treatments. 

## Description
This was the first website I built. I utilized HTML5 and CSS3 along with hypertext links to interconnect the 6 pages that make up the site. On the last page I utilized the form element to create a simple contact method. On the second to last page I used the table element to create a table to show the various skin treatment schedules recommended.
