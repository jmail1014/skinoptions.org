    <p>Challenges in the skin can present in different ways depending on your skin type, habits and environment (both internal and external). Here are some of the most common challenges that an Esthetician can address.</p>
  <h3 id="dry">Dry</h3>
    <p>Parched skin can look unsightly, even making your face appear older than it actually is and makeup difficult to apply, but it can also be itchy and painful and make your complexion susceptible to other issues, such as sensitivity and redness.</p>
    <p>Lack of hydration in skin makes your complexion dull and accentuates wrinkles, and it's more likely to occur in winter.</p>
    <p>Other potential factors prompting dry skin on the face can include irritating products that can strip natural oils, over-cleansing or exfoliating, which can also deplete skin's oils, as well as skin and health conditions that cause skin dehydration, such as atopic dermatitis (eczema), psoriasis, and diabetes.</p>
    <p>Regular scheduled <a href="treatments.html#facials">facials</a> are the best care for dry skin. The exfoliation and rehydration on a monthly baisis combined with your daily skincare regimen will reverse and balance dry skin</p>
  <h3 id="oily">Oily</h3>
    <p>Sebum or oil is vital for keeping the skin healthy. However, too much sebum can lead to oily skin, clogged pores, and acne. Managing oily skin often requires a person making regular skin care a habit.</p>
    <p>Oily skin that is linked to genetics can be difficult to prevent. Even oily skin caused by changes in hormones is difficult to control. The best prevention for oily skin is for an individual to find a consistent skin care routine that works, and to stick to it.</p>
    <p>When oily skin arises, it can be tempting to hide it with makeup. However, certain products, particularly oil-based products, could make symptoms worse or clog the pores.</p>
    <p>Treating oily skin with regular <a href="treatments.html#facials">facials</a> can lesson the amount of oil that the skin is producing.</p>
  <h3>Scarring</h3>
    <p>When a wound heals, it may eventually turn into a scar. Facial scars come in numerous forms and may be caused by injuries, acne, burns, or surgery. Since your face is constantly exposed to the environment, scars on this part of your body may have a harder time healing. Whereas you may be able to cover up or protect other areas of your body while a wound heals, your face is open to the elements for most of the day. It may not be possible to fully protect wounds on the face as they heal, and it may be difficult to keep treatments (e.g., ointments, creams) from rubbing away.</p>
    <p>Deep scarring is best treated with <a href="treatments.html#peels">chemical peels</a>. The peel will work beneath the surface of the skin to turn over new skin cells and promote new cell growth, which lessens the appearance of scars over time.
  <h3>Dark Spots</h3>
    <p>Types of dark spots or hyperpigmentation include age spots, melasma, and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation.</p>
    <p>Hyperpigmentation occurs when the skin produces more melanin, the pigment that gives skin its color. This can make spots or patches of skin appear darker than surrounding areas. Hyperpigmentation is a common skin condition. It affects people of all skin types. Some forms of hyperpigmentation, including melasma and sun spots, are more likely to affect areas of skin that face sun exposure, including the face, arms, and legs.</p>
    <p>Other types of hyperpigmentation form after an injury or skin inflammation, such as cuts, burns, acne, or lupus.</p>
    <p><a href="treatments.html#peels">Chemical Peels</a> are the best way to lighten and eliminate the appearance of dark spots on the skin. This in combination with topical ingredients can keep hyperpigmentation at bay after it's elimination. So regular scheduled peels may be in order if you are prones to dark spots caused by your environment</p>
  <h3>Fine Lines / Wrinkles</h3>
    <p>Repeated facial expressions cause fine lines and wrinkles to occur on the face. Facial movements and expressions, such as squinting or smiling, lead to fine lines and wrinkles. Each time you use a facial muscle, a groove forms beneath the surface of the skin. And as skin ages, it loses its flexibility and is no longer able to spring back in place.</p>
    <p>Another cause of fine lines and wrinkles arise because of irregular thickening of the dermis and because of a decrease in the amount of water held by the epidermis. This mainly occurs with sun damage and exposure to environmental toxins particularly tobacco smoke.</p>
    <p>Exfoliation is key in reducing and preventing fine lines. It will refine the skin so the lines are less deep as well as stimulate the skin's natural ability to increase hydration and plump the surface. <a href="treatments.html#peels">Peels</a> are the best approach to exfoliation when it comes to fine lines and wrinkles</p>
  <h3>Sagging</h3>
    <p>Skin laxity or drooping is caused by several factors. A reduction of the fat cells under the skin (subcutaneous tissue). Loss of collagen and elastin fibres in the dermis reducing cutaneous strength and elasticity. Gravity, which allows the lax tissue to sag.</p>
    <p>Stimulating the muscles and boosting the collegan/elastin in the face will help to pull the skin back to it's starting position. <a href="treatments.html#microcurrent">Microcurrent</a> is an effective treatment to reverse or prevent sagging.</p>
  <h3 id="bumps">Bumps or Breakouts</h3>
    <p>Pimples (pustules or papuals) or acne, blackheads, whiteheads, milla, Keratosis pilaris, atopic dermatitis (bumps caused by eczema) and acne rosacea (bumps caused by rosacea). These are the common bumps you'll find on the face.</p>
    <p>These bumps can be caused by all sorts of things, so determining which bump you have will make treating it easier.</P>
    <p>Getting regular <a href="treatments.html#facials">facials</a> (once a month) will help all bumps and breakouts and your Esthetician will identify the bump and how to treat it based on their observations. The regularity of the facials will help get rid of any irregularities on the face as well as prevent future brakouts from occuring.</p>
