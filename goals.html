      <p>Skin goals can be different from person to person. Some people may have multiple goals for their skin and some may be very minimal. These are just a few of the most common skin goals that can be addressed with an Esthetican.</p>
  <h3 id="brighten">Brighten</h3>
    <p>Bright skin is exactly what it sounds like. It almost looks as if it is glowing from the inside. It is healthy looking and this is usually because it is in a healthy state.</p>
    <p>To get brightened skin, you must have healthy skin. This can be achieved with exfoliation and hydrating ingredients applied regularly. If your skin does not have any build up caused by lack of exfoliation it will be able to function as it was meant to. This can also be boosted with extra hydration added to the skin.</p>
    <p>The recomended treatment for brighter skin is <a href="treatments.html#microdermabrasion">Microdermabrasion.</a> </p>

  <h3 id="smooth">Smooth Texture</h3>
    <p>Smooth texture is the absence of dips, bumps or lines.</p>
    <p>Texture is smooth when we are babies but diminishes with time. It can retained or achieved through exfoliation. Texture can occur with skin build-up, scarring caused by previous bumps and breakouts as well as fine lines caused by aging skin.</p>
    <p><a href="treatments.html#microdermabrasion">Microdermabrasion</a> is recommended for smoothing skin's texture</p>

  <h3 id="tone">Even Tone</h3>
    <p>Even toned skin has a consitant color hue. It is devoid of redness, dark spots or lighter pigmentation</p>
    <p>To bring the skin into an even tone one must eliminate redness, dark pots and light pigmentation. To do this <a href="treatments.html#microdermabrasion">Microdermabration</a> is recomended. When debris is removed the skin can be treated with products to break up any pigmentation that may be persistant inside the skin.</p>
  
  <h3 id="lift">Lift</h3>
    <p>Lifted skin is attached to the muscles of the face. It is untouched by gravity and gives the appearance of strong facial muscles and plump skin.</p>
    <p>With age skin can start to sag and because detatched from the muscles of the face.</p>
    <p>To improve the lift of the skin, you can treat it with <a href="treatments.html#microcurrent">Microcurrent</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="tighten">Tighten</h3>
    <p>Tight skin has elastisity and is held together tightly. This is the effect of having youthful skin. With time skin can loose elastisity and can become less tight.</p>
    <p> To solve this <a href="treatments.html#microcurrent">Microcurrent</a> is recommended.

  <h3 id="hydrate">Hydrate</h3>
    <p>Skin that is hydrated is plump, bright and healthy. The skin can be compared to a plump grape with a smooth and tightened appearance. Hydration is key to healthy and youthful looking skin because it functions best when it is hydrated.</p>
    <p>To gain skin that is hydrated, you must keep it at it's peak with regular scheduled <a href="treatments.html#facials">facials</a>. Having a facial once a month or once a week can improve the skin's hydration as well as many other functions.</p>

  <h3 id="plump">Plump</h3>
    <p>Plump skin is full of moisture and is functioning at it's peak.</p>
    <p>Regular <a href="treatments.html#facials">facials</a> will help the skin to become more plump.</p>
